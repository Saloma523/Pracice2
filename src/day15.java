    /*
    1.  Create a class named Marriage proposal and Write a program for the  marriage proposal program asking the user, "Will you marry me?"
    if the answer is yes, print "Congrats."
    if the answer is no, print "Goodbye"
    if the answer is neither yes nor no, print "Invalid answer, please re-enter" and repeat it until the user enters either yes or no
    */

    





/*
2. Create a class named PositiveNegative and write a program that asks user to enter number for 5 times, and print how many positive and negative numbers user entered
			Ex:
				Inputs:
					10
					20
					-1
					0
					3

				Output:
					3 positive and 1 negative


3. Create a class named FrequencyOfChar and Write a program that asks user to enter a string and a char, the returns the frequency of the char from the given string
            Ex:
                inputs:
                    str = "aabcccd";
                    char = 'c';

                output: 3

                inputs:
                    "Java programming language"
                    'g'

                output: 4

4.  Create a class named DivideTwoNumbers and Write a program that can divide two positive numbers without using / (division) and * (multiplication) operators.


5. Create a class named UntilNegative and Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user until user enters a negative number.


6. Create a class named DivisibleBy and Write a program that can print the numbers between 1 ~ N that can be divisible by 3, 5, and 15.
	            if the number can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15,
	                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy15' section

	            if the number can be divisible by 3 but cannot be divisible by 15,
	                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy3' section

	            if the number can be divisible by 5 but cannot be divisible by 15,
	                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy5' section

	            EX:
	                input: 100

	                Output:
	                     Divisible By 15: 15 30 45 60 75 90

	                     Divisible By 5:  5 10 20 25 35 40 50 55 65 70 80 85 95 100

	                     Divisible By 3: 3 6 9 12 18 21 24 27 33 36 39 42 48 51 54 57 63 66 69 72 78 81 84 87 93 96 99


7. you are writing a code for the log-in function of the Cydeo Application, assume that your credentials are:
                    username: Cydeo
                    password: Cydeo123

        Ask the user to enter their credentials.
                If credentials are matched, your program should print "Logged in."
                If the credentials are not matched, the program should allow the user to have three attempts to enter correct credentials and if all three attempts are failed, then print "Your account is lucked."


8. Create a class called RoomReservation, write a program for the room reservation, your program asks the user wants to reserve a room.
    	if user entered yes, then ask which type of room the user wants to reserve. if user entered no, print "have a nice day"
    			(if user entered any invalid answer (other than yes/no) ask user to reenter until user provides a valid entry)

	            King Bed ==> 120$
	            Queen Bed ==> 100$
	            single Bed ==> 80$

            the program should be able to display the room he/she reserved and total price of the room.

            (if the user selected an invalid room, ask the user to reselect the room until user provides a valid entry)

9. Create a class called UniqueCharacters, Write a program that can return the unique characters from a String

	            Ex:
	                input:
	                    AABCCD

	                output:
	                    BD
